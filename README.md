# Flutter ECG Monitoring App with Firebase Database
This project introduces an ECG (Electrocardiogram) monitoring solution utilizing the ESP32 microcontroller and the AD8232 ECG sensor. The system allows for remote monitoring of a patient's ECG data, enabling healthcare professionals to track their cardiac health from a distance. Additionally, a dedicated Flutter app for doctors provides access to real-time ECG data, facilitated by Firebase for secure and scalable data storage and retrieval.

Features:

    Remote ECG Monitoring: Monitor a patient's ECG data remotely using the ESP32 microcontroller and AD8232 ECG sensor.
    Real-Time Data Transmission: Transmit ECG data wirelessly to the monitoring app in real time for immediate analysis.
    Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor the patient's ECG signals to detect any abnormalities or irregularities.
    Doctor's App: Provide doctors with a dedicated Flutter app to access and analyze real-time ECG data from their patients.
    Secure Data Storage: Utilize Firebase for secure and scalable storage of patient ECG data, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

Technologies Used:

    ESP32 Microcontroller: Processes and transmits ECG data wirelessly to the monitoring app.
    AD8232 ECG Sensor: Captures the patient's ECG signals for monitoring and analysis.
    esp32 Wi-Fi Connectivity: Enables esp32  wireless transmission of ECG data to the monitoring app.
    Firebase Database: Provides secure and scalable storage of patient ECG data, accessible in real time by healthcare professionals.
    Flutter Framework: Develop a dedicated app for doctors using the Flutter framework to access and analyze real-time ECG data.
